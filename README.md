## Documentation
Versioning History and Repository control was maintained by each member of Team 1. Each member was assigned a task and pushed commits to their own individual branches within the main repository. During in-person meetings, all pushes to the main branch were discussed and verified before the action occured. This resulted in a cleaner versioning history.
